# Tusky
###### Real-time quiz application

## Code Style
Tusky is auto-formatted using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

The only non-standard quirk: definitions for `__all__` should be at the top of a module, not the bottom.
This way module exports are able to be found easily without searching.
